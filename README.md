## Installation

Download the ``PassGen.py`` file using:

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/varnull-code/PassGen/main/PassGen.py
```

or if ``wget`` is not available, you can use ``curl`` instead:

```sh
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/varnull-code/PassGen/main/PassGen.py
```

## Usage

Ensure Python 3 is installed.
To run:
- Bash: Add execution permissions to the file with ``chmod +x PassGen.py`` then run with ``python3 PassGen.py``
- PowerShell/CMD: Use ``python3 {file location}\PassGen.py``
- Use options such as ``-h`` to find out all options. A quick guide is to use ``-l {length}`` for quick password generation or use ``-m`` to use the full menu mode of the program.
