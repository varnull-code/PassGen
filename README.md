Ensure Python 3 is installed.
To run:
- Bash: Add execution permissions to the file with ``chmod +x PassGen.py`` then run with ``python3 PassGen.py``
- PowerShell/CMD: Use ``python3 {file location}\PassGen.py``
- Use options such as ``-h`` to find out all options. A quick guide is to use ``-l {length}`` for quick password generation or use ``-m`` to use the full menu mode of the program.
